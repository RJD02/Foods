# Anyone Hungry?
## I can't solve hunger,
### But I Can Show You Cool, Repsonsive Site [here](https://rjd02.github.io/Foods/)

The site is responsive, and has different behaivour for different sizes

### Lessons Learnt:
- Make sure the script, styles are linked with HTML(Felt insanely stupid for solid 5 minutes after that);
- It's impossible to remember all CSS properties so get good at googling it;
- There is always an CSS property for a effect you want;
- The power of Chrome Dev Tools is what you need to master;
- Refactor time to time;
- Plans never go as intended, so organize the testing;
- Branch early and branch often;
- Divide the page into sections, as many as possible, here I did 4;
- Use [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/), if nothing better it is better than vanilla JS. Trust me it's a lot better;
- Making animations is easier with jQuery;
- Follow a naming convention, I was recommended and I followed camel casing;
- Make sure last touches don't break the code;
